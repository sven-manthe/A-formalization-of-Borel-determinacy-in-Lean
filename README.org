* A formalization of Borel determinacy in Lean
This project formalizes Martin's theorem on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_determinacy_theorem][Borel determinacy]], using Lean 4 and mathlib. We roughly follow his paper [[https://www.ams.org/books/pspum/042/]["A purely inductive proof of Borel determinacy"]] after defining Gale-Stewart games and proving closed determinacy. A more detailed description can be found in the [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03432][preprint]].\\
Parts of the project have been added to mathlib (https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/11626, https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/18349, https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/18458, https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/18763, https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/18985, https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/19546, https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/21234)
